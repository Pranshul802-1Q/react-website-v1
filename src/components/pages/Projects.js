              The Pan Himalayan Grassroots Development Foundation is established as a non-profit
              voluntary organization under the Societies Registration Act (1860) at the office of the
              Registrar of Societies, Delhi since November 1992. The primary aim of Grassroots is to
              initiate peoples action at the grassroots for restoration of ecological security in languishing
              river basins through holistic mountain development programs, in order to improve the quality
              of life.
              <br/><br/>
              Over the past fifteen years, Grassroots has been able to evolve a holistic intervention
              strategy which channels resources - managerial, technical and financial - directly to people
              and associations of the communities, working at the village/watershed level.
              The emphasis is on self-help participation and the belief that average villagers have the
              desire, the right and the capability to promote their own welfare and prosperity and to
              participate in decisions that affect their lives.<br/><br/>

              Gupta writes that in his area farmers burn paddy straw, wheat straw, sugarcane leaves etc.,
              which are valuable organic matter to the soil. He has instead turned his ten acre sandy soil
              into clay soil by adding cow dung, paddy ash, sugarcane press mud etc. He practises organic
              farming.
              <br/><br/>
              One of the prime areas of concern is the restoration of Gagas river basin, wherein
              environmental degradation has led to impoverishment of more than 300 communities spread
              over 500 square kms. As an integral part of this eco-restoration effort, communities are being
              motivated to adopt the participatory guarantee system for certification of traditonal farming
              systems as Organic, with the idea of establishing a bridge between farm-gates and consumers
              and thereby sustaining traditional farming practices.<br/><br/>
